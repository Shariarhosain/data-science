the average fortune 500 company aside from the shortterm loss the companys longterm health is in jeopardy if the strategic decisionmaking process does not improve making longterm plans and choices is a tough function its fraught with risk uncertainty ambiguity and complexity additionally barriers like time constraints executive biases team conflict and knowledge gaps can make it further challenging for executives to make sound business decisions technology cannot solve issues like bias and conflicts but can help you improve speed agility collaboration accuracy and monitoring technology can also help you understand the risk associated with each decision and help you develop strategies to futureproof your choices in this article we explore 11 ways technology can supercharge how you develop and adopt effective strategic decisions that drive revenue growth companies struggle with gathering and leveraging data from multiple sources customer relationship management tools social media websites industry data government data etc and talk more about digging deep to gain valuable insights this challenge has to do with the four dimensions of data volume the sheer volume of data companies generate these days is massive velocity the speed with which they generate data is at an incredible pace veracity parts of the data generated will be valuable and others not variety companies generate data from multiple sources and in different formats technology makes it possible to aggregate data from multiple sources and convert them to formats that can be easily queried kippy offers nocode integrations and api to mix data from various sources and have a single source of truth for your strategic objectives after aggregating data into a single pipeline businesses need to perform data analysis to query the data for helpful and relevant insights decisionmakers can find patterns or identify themes discover connections categorize things spot unusual situations and more to get to this point companies need tools to clean process visualize and manipulate data a task typically beyond the scope of spreadsheets tools like tableau microsoft power bi python mysql oracle rapidminer sas ibm cognos analytics etc are examples of aipowered tools companies use to analyze and visualize data for intelligent datadriven decisionmaking in our introduction we stated that making decisions for the future is inherent with risks and uncertainty technology can help ease some of these burdens with risk analysis and mitigation this form of technology is known as augmented intelligence a subsegment of artificial intelligence ai it uses machine learning and statistical algorithms to analyze historical data and make deductions about potential possibilities in the future these potential possibilities include forecasting numbers identifying potential risks and optimizing resource allocation for future projects for companies removing uncertainty can be the difference between making a prompt decision and dawdling because of the unknown thus delaying critical business operations in a survey by mckinsey 57 of respondents satisfied with the business result of their decisions said dissenting voices were given an ample opportunity to express themselves compared to 36 of respondents who experienced unsatisfactory business results the result of that survey underpins the importance of effective communication during the strategic decisionmaking process simply put making informed decisions requires input from all stakeholders executives can lean on a diverse pool of skills backgrounds experiences and perspectives the more diverse the better per mckinsey companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25 percent more likely to have aboveaverage profitability than companies in the fourth quartile simple technology tools like slack trello google workspace and asana facilitate realtime communication and collaboration according to paul nutt ohio state university management professor and author of why decisions fail avoiding the blunders and traps that lead to debacles the root cause of decision failure is selecting from a limited pool of potential options or solutions paul nutt found that executives only examine one additional alternative 70 of the time when making important strategic decisions yet he found evidence that enlarging the pool of alternatives improves the quality of decisions foundational problems like ego haste and biased motives may be responsible for executives sticking to one alternative technology cannot fix those but it may help you garner and brainstorm more alternatives weve established how building a pool of alternatives improves the probability of making quality decisions but how do you evaluate these alternatives its through analysis of alternatives aoa tools and frameworks used for an aoa include scenario analysis consensus tracking for decision management costbenefit analysis risk evaluation suitability swot analysis pest analysis lifecycle cost project timeline and sensitivity analysis the key factor here is to define the problem objectives and business context and then determine the overriding ground rules your analysis will be based on simul8 is a great example of a tool used by organizations to experiment with business processes and plan scenarios sap and oracle have modules and features for performing cost analysis and risk assessment bounded rationality is one of the challenges leaders face when making decisions management school of thought defines this as the notion that challenging complex issues that leaders cannot fully grasp makes them unable to be rational about the situation and are therefore incapable of understanding an alternative amongst decision makers there are likely those with limited knowledge about a particular business problem or parts of it executives must research and go through plenty of pages to bridge that gap technology tools can help leaders can use ai tools for swot analysis research market trends and summarize competitors annual reports in seconds additionally you can build custom solutions using the same models that power these ai tools these solutions are built on your companys data as such you can query such applications to get more information about the customer journey a department product or service the decisionmaking process has many tedious and repetitive tasks that take your time every productive hour counts in todays world where speed agility and timetomarket matter for example lets say you want openended feedback from your customers or employees about a decision itll take you days and maybe weeks to sift through each response to uncover valuable insight particularly if you have a large customer or employee base you can deploy automated text analytics to tag each comment and classify them based on sentiment and theme this process simplifies your work and you can easily dig into the topics that matter to your decision you may also like how to manage your corporate strategy using artificial intelligence tools like kippy help executives and line managers cascade strategic

of performance across your desired unit you may also like how to set kpi targets that drive business growth some things are best seen rather than imagine what an experience may feel like for customers
